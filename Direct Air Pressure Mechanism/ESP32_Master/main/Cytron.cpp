 *
 * We already have an array, where the first block stores the header, i.e. 85
 * so, what we need to do is calculate the last 3 blocks and send the packet to the
 * cytron.
 *
 * We calculate the packet 1 by left shifting the channel 3 times, and simply performing
 * an OR operation with the shifted channel value,
 *
 * Example Channel is 1 and address is 101
 * So if we perform three times left shift we get 1000 (8) and finally, we perform
 * OR operation, we get 1101 (13), which is the required value.
 *
 * The packet 2 is the PWM, and finally the packet 3 is the checksum, which is the
 * addition of first three packets.
